.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
script takes files and directories as input with given flags and prints out a
readable result of valid HTCondor log files.
There are 4 main modes to work with this facility.
The default and analyser mode are mostly made for single log analytics.
The summariser and analysed-summary mode,
are made to summarise huge collections of log files,
to give a view on the average used resources and occurred errors.
More details about the different modes below.
.Pp
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.
.It Ar FILES
just pass any log files, config files or directories, you just need to separate them by space.
.
.It Ar OPTIONS
.
.It Fl h | Fl Fl help
Prints a summary of
.Nm Ap s
command\[hy]line options and exits.
.
.It Fl m Ar mode | Fl Fl mode Ar mode
Specify the mode, to interpret HTCondor log files,
.Bd -literal
Valid arguments:
 ['a' or 'analyse', 's' or 'summarize',
 'as' or 'analysed-summary', 'd' or 'default']
.Ed
.Bd -literal
the standard mode of the script is 'default'

default mode:
    This mode just provides a really basic overview,
    about how the output can look like
    and what information is gathered.

analyse mode:
    For more detailed output, use the analyser mode.
    Features:
    - provides ram histogram
    - shows HTCondor errors
    - more details in general
    - have a look in running processes

summarize mode:
    summarise a collection of log files based on its used resources
    Features:
    - average usages of all collected log files
    - average usage and durations on each host node
    NOTE: this will ignore running, aborted and other processes,
          that do not contain details about the resource usages

analysed-summary mode:
    This mode is a combination of the summariser and analyser mode.
    Features:
    - Seperate the summation based on the termination types
    - Also handles running processes

.Op Fl m Ar mode | Fl Fl mode Ar mode
.Op Fl Fl extend
.
.It Fl m Ar mode | Fl Fl mode Ar mode
Forward the results, to be processed.
.It Fl Fl extend
will include these keywords:
.Bd -literal
["err", "error", "warn", "warning", "exception",
 "aborted", "abortion", "abnormal", "fatal"]
.Ed
.El
.Bd -literal
search inside the given files or directories
for the given keywords,
if you want to show multiple information,
separate them by space like:
--filter err warn ...
.Ed
.Bd -literal
you can forward the result to be processed by a mode
directly with the additional --mode flag
.Ed
.Bd -literal
Note: This option is NOT case sensitive
.Ed
.Bd -literal
if you want to find any kind of termination,
that is not normal, use --extend:
.Ed
.Bd -literal
Examples:
--filter exception gpu -s
--filter error warnings --mode analyse
.Ed
.
.It Fl Fl std-log Ar standard-log
The standard log files usually look something like
.Qq job_452_237.log ,
if for whatever reason the format is not
.Qq .log ,
then you can change it with this argument.
.
.It Fl Fl std-err Ar standard-err
The standard error files usually look something like
.Qq job_452_237.err ,
if for whatever reason the format is not
.Qq .err ,
then you can change it with this argument.
.
.It Fl Fl std-out Ar standard-out
The standard output files usually look something like
.Qq job_452_237.out ,
if for whatever reason the format is not
.Qq .out ,
then you can change it with this argument.
.
.It Fl Fl show-more Ar keywords
show information inside the (if generated) stdout and stderr files,
related to the current log file.
.Bd -literal
Valid arguments are:

[std-err, std-out]

errors and warnings regarding a stderr file (.err)
output to get every line of the stdout file (.out)

if you want to show multiple information,
separate them by space like:
--show std-err std-out
.Ed
.
.It Fl Fl ignore Ar keywords
ignore a given set of information
.Bd -literal
Valid arguments are:

[execution-details, times, errors, host-nodes,
 used-resources, requested-resources,
 allocated-resources, all-resources]

if you want to ignore multiple information,
separate them by space like:
--ignore times errors
.Ed
.
.It Fl Fl no-config
Do not search for a config file
.
.It Fl Fl reverse-dns-lookup
Resolve the host the job was running on by it's ip address
to a related domain name, if possible.
Else, go with the ip address.
.
.It Fl v | Fl Fl verbose
Start the script in verbose mode, this will generate more detailed output,
about what the script is doing
but printing it to stdout
.
.It Fl Fl generate-log-file
Related to the verbose mode,
this will generate the same output but not onto the terminal.
This will create a log rotation file: htcompact.log or append output to it.
The maximum size is limited by 1 MB,
which means the output starts to rollover on a backup file: htcompact.log.1
.
.It Fl Fl table-format Ar format
the table format for the output
.
valid arguments are:
.
[plain, simple, github, grid, fancy_grid, pipe,
orgtbl, rst, mediawiki, html, latex, latex_raw,
latex_booktabs, tsv, pretty]
.
default: pretty
.El
.
.Sh CONFIG
.Bd -literal -compact
furthermore all these variables|settings can be set inside a config file.
See the config specification:
.Lk https://github.com/psyinfra/htcompact/blob/master/CONFIG.md
.
The script is also checking for other config files in other places:
.
"project_directory/config", "/etc" and "~/.config/htcompact/"
.Ed
.Bd -literal
with different priorities from 1 (high) to 5 (low):
Priority[1] find config_file directly
Priority[2] search for config_file in project_directory/config
Priority[3] search for config_file in ~/.config/htcompact
Priority[4] search for config_file in /etc
Priority[5] run with default settings
.Ed
.
.Sh FEATURES
.Bd -literal -compact
- Always try to generate output, if possible
- Listening to stdin to make the use of tools like grep possible
-> --filter is a more naive alternative to grep
.Ed
.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa script/htcompact.conf
A default setup for this script.
